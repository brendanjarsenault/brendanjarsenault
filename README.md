Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Brendan J. Arsenault, a software engineering student from the US. I love coffee, gaming and woodworking. I am passionate about bringing ideas to life. I work in IT as a help desk technician but at night, I'm studying to be a full-time software engineer, focusing on Java and C#. Also, I am a keen supporter for Open Source software and I am looking to contribute to FOSS projects as well.
